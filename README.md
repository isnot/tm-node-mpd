This is fork of [node-mpd](https://github.com/Prior99/node-mpd) project by Frederick Gnodtke.

tm-node-mpd is a library for simple communicating with a [music player daemon](http://www.musicpd.org/).
It uses a IPC and TCP-socket to communicate with the daemon and provides a list of highlevel promise based methods.

Make sure to take a look at the [examples](https://github.com/RomanBurunkov/tm-node-mpd/tree/master/examples).

Note that 0.2 branch was experimental. Do not use is it at all.

Available options
------

You can pass options object to the MPD constructor.
The following options are available:

* **type** connection type('ipc' or 'network'), default value is 'network'.
* **ipc** path to the unix socket(ipc), default value is '/var/run/mpd/socket'.
* **host** mpd service host, default value is 'localhost'.
* **port** mpd service TCP port, default value is 6600.

Events
------

* ready - Emits after connected to the MPD service.
* error - Emits when any errors occured.
* update - Emits when got any updates from MPD service.
* status - Emits when MPD service status has been updated.
* disconnected - Emits after disconnecting from MPD service.

Methods
------

This part of doc is still in progress.
Please see the source code for all public methods.

* `connect` connects to the mpd.
* `disconnect` disconnects from the mpd.
* `alive` returns true if instance connected to the mpd.
* `command` sends a basic command specified in the first argument. Other arguments will be used as a commant parameters. E.g.

```javascript
  mpd.command('setvol', vol);
```

Example
------
This is a minimal exmaple which connects to a mpd running on localhost on the default port and prints the current playlist:

	const MPD = require('tm-node-mpd');
	const mpd = new MPD(); // pass { type: 'ipc' } to connect local mpd via unix socket.

```javascript
	mpd.on('ready', () => {
		for (let num = 0; num < mpd.playlist.length; num += 1) {
			const n = num + 1;
			console.log(n + ": " + mpd.playlist[num].artist + " - " + mpd.playlist[num].title);
		}
		mpd.disconnect();
	});
```
